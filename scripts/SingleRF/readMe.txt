grid_search.py - does a grid search to optimize the parameters of the single random forest

rf_conditional.py - runs a single random forest to predict the probability of precipitation

TF_randomForest.py - A TensorFlow implementation of the random forest that is slower than the scikit-learn implementation, at least as coded right now.
