This is a repository with the scripts and output data from the 2019 summer SIParCS project on statistical downscaling. 

Folders in this repository:

  *scripts* - The folder containing the Python scripts that fit the models and make predictions.
  
  *shellScripts* - The bash scripts to run on Casper to fit the models and make predictions. These shell scripts call the python scripts in the scripts folder and run them in parallel.
  
  *animations* - Several animations of the outputs of the predictions from the models.
  
  *input_data* - 'prepped' data used to train the models. All files are netCDFs.
  
  *FinalModelPreds* - Datasets containing the predictions for odd years from 1980-2010 from models trained using the even years in the same period. Predictions are saved as NetCDF files.
